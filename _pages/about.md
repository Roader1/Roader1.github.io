I'm the first year phd student from [School of ECE](https://ece.hkust.edu.hk/), Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. I spent four years in the [School of Microeletronics](https://sme.fudan.edu.cn/) from 2020 to 2024. My research direction includes FPGA-based LLM acceleration, software-hardware codesign. 

I'm honored to be co-advised by [Prof.Zhang Wei](https://seng.hkust.edu.hk/about/people/faculty/wei-zhang) and [Prof.Li Xin](https://faculty.dukekunshan.edu.cn/faculty_profiles/xin-li). If you are interested in our group, please feel free to contact Prof.Zhang!

Out of research, I'm fond of working out and PC games. Maybe it's a good opportunity to contact me and we can do some research and have some fun together.
